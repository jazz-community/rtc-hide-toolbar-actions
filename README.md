# Hide Work Item Actions
Do you want to prevent users from using some of the actions in the work item editor? Maybe there is a type of work item that people shouldn't be able to copy or move to a different project area. Or maybe you just don't need all of the built in actions and would like to hide some for a cleaner interface. This plugin enables you to achieve these goals.

Using this plugin you can hide built-in work item actions. The plugin can be configured per project area and work item type to give you full control over what is hidden and when.
